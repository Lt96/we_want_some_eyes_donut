Everything else if coded by someome else.
## Detail of each code
1. click roi save excel.ipynb: 
In cup and disc segmentation development, developers need to crop an image for the ROI. 
Croping all images every time they run their program is not time efficiency. 
This program requires a user to click once at optic disc center on every images and save the image name
and clicked coordinate into an excel file ROI.xlsx. 
2. cup disc ver1 failed.ipynb: 
This code contains some newbie failed trials.
3. findCDR.ipynb: 
This code is finalized version of CDR reader which cantain OD localization, OD and OC segmentation.
Input an image to get CDR.
4. fungi blood vessel.ipynb (modify from https://github.com/solivr/frangi_filter): 
Blood vessel segmentation with Frangi filter
5. Glaucoma_CDR_finder_program.ipynb: 
The Glaucama CDR program with simple user interface
6. groundtruthReader.ipynb: 
This code read the whole doctor lebeld image and out put OD size, OC size, and CDR in excel and images. 
7. retinal vessel segmentation(Binary Hausdorff Symmetry) failed.ipynb: 
This is a failed attempt to segment blood vessel with Binary Hausdorff Symmetry approch
8. ROI_from_excel.ipynb: 
This code output ROI image from excel file ROI.xlsx and raw image. This code was built to combo with the
first code.
9. VSL.ipynb: 
Vessel symmetry line measure OD segmentation approch.
